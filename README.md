The files here manage the data aquisition needed in the CMP Superconductivity
experiement. 

Please read through the source code and try to understand how it
works. This is a great skill to practice. See the
[tutorial](CMP_SC_RUN_EXAMPLE.pdf) for implentation details. 


## Requirements 
The following python libraries ust be installed on your computer
- numpy
- pyusb
- pyvisa
- threading
- array
- time

To find a list of modules that are available for your python distribution open a
python console or jupyter-notebook file and run:
`help("modules")`
This command will output a list of python modules you have available. If one of
